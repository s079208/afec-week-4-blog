> “Never invest in things you don’t understand”

Recently I have stopped purchasing or paying for some of the items and there are tons of reasons for this — primarily being for financial purposes.

We spend so much money on these items that we don’t necessarily need or that add more stress to our lives that we can end up cutting/getting rid of. And it’s going to free up a lot more cash in your life.
You may find some interest in this as well, to really cut back on these expenses, to free up cash that you can then use on vacation. You can use this cash to invest in your retirement.

But I think it’s great to have some extra money left over at the end of the month, and that has always been my goal at the end of the day.

Sale Items
When it comes to sales — when you’re buying items, you want to be very, very careful of this, because I find that a lot of my friends — for example, will end up spending $1000 on a shopping trip and they’ll say that, “it actually is worth $1500 and they saved $500 because of the sale and it was 50% off and they got a great deal of just $1000”.

But then my thought process is more so — you didn’t save $500, you spent $1000 and you have that much amount less in your bank today than you had yesterday and is the absolute truth.

That’s really how I view it — and you want to just think about this going forward, that’s just because something’s on sale doesn’t necessarily mean that you are going to save money on this item.

I try my best to not be affected by sales. When I am in need of something — I’ll just go out and buy that thing. I never try to get much affected by sales and discounts.

So there are obviously times where sales can make sense, where it’s coming up on winter and their summer items that are on sale or vice versa. If it’s winter and you want to buy summer items — that could just make more sense and you could save more money.

But we’re talking about the 70 percent off carpet blowout sale or the mattress blowout sale — the ones that happen all the time and the same go for cars as well.

It’s really kind of my idea is that you’re going to pay the market price for most items. So I just don’t bother trying to get as many sales as some other people might do. And this actually goes for couponing as well. I’ve seen people use coupons and they end up spending twice or thrice as much money as somebody who doesn’t use coupons because they’re buying items that they just have no need for — they think that it is essential to buy three of four to get one free and they end up spending more money, which is stupid.
So just keep that in mind as you go forward with buying items in the future in the psychology of purchasing things and how that really affects you.

# Beverage Drinks
Another thing that I stopped buying almost altogether is any type of drinks, whether it be sugary drinks, even a lot of alcohol I don’t really buy as it just kills brain cells. But the average American consumes over forty-four gallons of soda per year and that explains a lot of the health problems that we have in America.

But it’s really not only a financial expense — it’s going to cost you a lot of money buying sugary drinks, buying soda, fruit juice in a lot of cases, and bottled water. I just drink tap water. I filter it through a filter. You can even get a more fancy filter, if you like, for thirty dollars and you’re good for quite some time by just drinking water. I don’t really need anything else and this isn’t really actually for real financial reasons.

It’s more so just because most drinks and fluids that you put in your body that aren’t water, they’re not going to be very healthy for you. And in a lot of cases, they are loaded with sugar and it’s just not good for you. This saved me a lot of money and it is also a very healthy option to opt-out of these things.
