I wasn’t a poor student — far from it. I finished in the top three students in my MBA program while holding down a full-time job, running marathons, and dating. So when my daughter couldn’t learn basic sight words in Kindergarten, I didn’t understand. I found myself screaming at her to focus.

I thought she didn’t try hard enough. I wanted to tear my hair out when she struggled with grade-level reading in second grade. Chapter books were a nightmare in frustration.
Now, she’s nine and in third grade. Not much has changed, but after months of online learning and homeschooling, I finally realized something was wrong. She has dyslexia.

I won’t lie. My heart broke for her. My mind went to the darkest place — one where she doesn’t graduate from college and earns minimum wage her entire life. I wanted school to be easy for her — the way it was for me. I wanted her to be successful. So I did what I always do when I don’t know anything about a subject. I started reading and boy, was I wrong.

Some of the wealthiest and most successful business leaders in our history have/had dyslexia. They are entrepreneurs like Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Steve Jobs, and Charles Schwab. They are authors like Vince Flynn, Agatha Christine, and Ann Rice. They are inventors like Thomas Edison.

Most of all — they were poor students who can teach us a lot about entrepreneurship and what really matters when it comes to creating wealth. I’ll first explain the connection between entrepreneurship and dyslexia and then cover five lessons we can learn from studying their unique style.

# Entrepreneurs and Dyslexia
Dr. Julie Logan, professor of entrepreneurship at the Cass School of Business, conducted ground-breaking research on the surprising connection between dyslexia and entrepreneurship.

Dr. Logan found that in the U.S., 35 percent (out of 15 percent of the general population) of entrepreneurs have dyslexia. In the U.K., 20 percent (out of 4 percent of the general population) are dyslexic. The difference in general population numbers is because the U.S. puts dyslexia into a larger category of total learning disorders and the U.K doesn’t.
