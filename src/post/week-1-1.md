Why should I switch my website to RWD?
Your website looks great of the desktop screen but it may not be true when your site is viewed on a smartphone or a tablet. Once you make the design responsive, the website will look good (and readable) on all screens.

With Responsive Design you can create one design and it will automatically adapt itself based on the screen size of the mobile device. This approach offers plenty of advantages:

* It saves time and money as you don’t have to maintain separate websites for desktops and mobile phones.

* Responsive Design is good for your website’s SEO (search rankings) as every page on your site will have a single URL and thus Google juice is preserved. You don’t have to worry about situations where some sites link to your mobile site while others link to your desktop site.

* Your Google Analytics reports will paint a better picture of your site’s usage since the data from mobile and desktop users will be consolidated.

* The same will be true for the social sharing stats (Facebook Likes, Tweets, +1’s) since the mobile and desktop versions of your web pages will have the same URL.

* Responsive Designs are easier to maintain as they do not involve any server-side components. You just have to modify the underlying CSS of a page to change its appearance (or layout) on a particular device.
