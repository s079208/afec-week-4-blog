 	<h3>Blogpost: Elon Musk’s 2 Rules For Learning Anything Faster</h3>
  <p>Learning is one of the overcommunicated but underleveraged tools of the common entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Everyone talks about methods of learning, but few people find realistic and authentic techniques that actually yield a net profit in the information and application categories.</p>
<p>Elon Musk has broken through that barrier with learning techniques that have proven successful not just once, but time and time again.</p>
<p>A good argument could be made that Musk has leveraged his learning by becoming a disruptor. He and his companies have shifted entire industries, including the transportation sector, the energy sector, and the space sector.</p>
<p>He recently announced at a press conference that his plans for his biotech company Neuralink are progressing quite nicely, hinting at yet another sector which his hands will likely shift in the coming years.</p>
<p>Yes, Musk is a once-in-a-lifetime genius. Likely on the same levels as Nikola Tesla, Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton. He has a different way of viewing problems than the average entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Of course, he reads hundreds of books. He works with top-level thinkers. He has astronomical levels of funding to put towards his every whim. But that’s not what makes him a great learner.</p>
<p>His learning methods aren’t that regal. In fact, his two rules for how to learn anything faster can be implemented by anyone at any time. Including you.</p>
<p>You, too, can be a rocket scientist, if you wanted. Here’s how.</p>
<h1>Identify the different parts of the tree</h1>
<p>When it comes to learning, Musk is quick to note that he believes that most people can learn more than they currently know.</p>
<p>When it comes to the average entrepreneur, Musk claims that they often don’t break through their perceived limits and try to learn beyond their current capacity. Or, as he goes on to clarify, they don’t know how to outline their information in a way that leads to further revelation.</p>
